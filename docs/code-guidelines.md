# Coding Guidelines

## General
* Don't reinvent the wheel
  * Use the framework wherever you can
  * Copy and paste is NOT your friend.
    * You need code from a method in another method? Move it into an own method and call it instead.
* Rely on open source wherever you can
* Keep it simple
  * Use variable names that make sense.
  * Every indent increases the complexity and decreases readability.
* Keep it small
  * Every method should have very specific task. Subtasks belong into own methods.
* Document and comment
  * Obviously...
